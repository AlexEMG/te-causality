{"name":"TE-causality","body":"# TE-Causality\r\n\r\nA software package consists of the source code used for the Transfer Entropy (TE) based measure of effective connectivity (called Generalized Transfer Entropy, or GTE) published in [Model-free Reconstruction of Neuronal Network Connectivity from Calcium Imaging Signals (pre-print)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0732).\r\n\r\nExtract effective connectivities based on spike times, have it simulate fluorescence signals for you, or supply your own signal. As TE is model-independent, virtually any kind of signal can be used.\r\n\r\nAlso included are other causality measures for comparison:\r\n\r\n- _xcorr_, time-lagged cross-correlation\r\n- _mi_, time-lagged Mutual information\r\n- _granger_, Granger Causality (time domain)\r\n\r\nIt also contains three methods of estimating TE and GTE without binning:\r\n\r\n- _te-binless-Leonenko_, based on: L.F. Kozachenko and N.N. Leonenko, [Sample Estimate of the Entropy of a Random Vector](http://www.mathnet.ru/php/archive.phtml?wshow=paper&jrnid=ppi&paperid=797&option_lang=eng), Problems of Information Transmission, 1987\r\n- _te-binless-Kraskov_, based on: A. Kraskov et al., [Estimating Mutual Information](http://pre.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v69/i6/e066138), Physical Review E, 2004\r\n- _te-binless-Frenzel_, based on: S. Frenzel and B. Pompe, [Partial Mutual Information for Coupling Analysis of Multivariate Time Series](http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v99/i20/e204101), Physical Review Letters, 2007\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n### GTE\r\n\r\nTo compile the GTE binaries based on binned estimates, all you need is a standard C++ compiler, and the following libraries:\r\n\r\n- [GNU Scientific Library (GSL)](http://www.gnu.org/s/gsl/)\r\n- [Boost](http://www.boost.org/)\r\n- and Christoph Kirsts's [SimKernel](https://github.com/ChristophKirst/SimKernel) package\r\n\r\nPlease make sure that GSL and Boost are available to your C++ linker, and that the path to the SimKernel files is correctly set in the Rakefile.\r\n\r\n### Light scattering\r\n\r\nTo simulate light scattering, we need to load the spatial positions of each node from a YAML file. You therefore need to have the [yaml-cpp](http://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp) libraries installed.\r\n\r\n### Binless methods\r\n\r\nTo use the binless estimators, you also need to install Marius Muja's excellent [FLANN](https://github.com/mariusmuja/flann) (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors) package and make it available to your linker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Configuration etc.\r\n\r\nFor details, please consult the [Readme in the source repository](https://github.com/olavolav/te-causality).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nAll of the files can be copied, modified, used for commercial or non-commercial purpose, as long as you keep the following copyright message in the source files:\r\n\r\n(ADD SOMETHING HERE LATER!)\r\n","tagline":"Generalized Transfer Entropy for connectivity analysis.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
